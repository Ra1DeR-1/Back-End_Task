# Back-End_Task
I was trying to do a backend on python. this is my first backend
There are a couple of flaws in my code, I'm very sorry. But it seems that I managed to implement CRUD. It creates a json file and uses it as a database. Implemented functions:
c - is the creation of an element
g - is taking a certain element, knowing the id and username
u - is updating the element (its password) by entering the username
d - is deleting the element by id
